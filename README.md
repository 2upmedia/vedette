Vedette
=======

# About
User Management Skeleton based on several Laravel packages provided by the laravel community.


# Requirements
* Bootstrap 3.x
* Font-Awesome 4.x

## packages
* "illuminate/support": "4.0.x"      // Need to make sure laravel exists
* "cartalyst/sentry": "2.0.*"        // Obvious what this is for
* "anahkiasen/former": "dev-master"  // used for forms
* "illuminate3/lingos": "dev-master" // used for lang files. Lingos is an attempt to centralize commonly used words and phrases.


# Version
1.0.0

* Fork Steve Montambeault's Cpanel package into Vedette (Keep Steve's authorship but change out PSR naming)
* Redo views to allow a more generic approach to using in main app
* Add in some missing functions that Brunogaspar's package includes


## Future
* Take more advantage of the anahikiasen/former package
* Verify the validators that are being used
* A better read to explain how to configure the package better
